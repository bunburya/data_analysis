introduction = """**Introduction**

On 1 January 2019, the Securitisation Regulation came into force in the European Union (EU).  The Securitisation Regulation created a new regulatory regime for securitisations in Europe.  Among other things, it created a new category of securitisations, known as "simple, transparent and standardised" (STS) securitisations.  Securitisations can be classified as STS if they meet certain requirements set out in the Securitisation Regulation (as supplemented by various delegated rules and technical standards).  Investments in STS securitisations receive preferential capital treatment under the EU's capital requirements regulations, reflecting the fact that STS securitisations are considered to be safer than non-STS securitisations.

More information about the Securitisation Regulation and the STS regime can be found on [the website of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)](https://www.esma.europa.eu/policy-activities/securitisation)

When a securitisation is notified to ESMA as being an STS securitisation, ESMA publishes certain details about that securitisation on its website.  Those details are currently published as [a spreadsheet](https://www.esma.europa.eu/policy-activities/securitisation/simple-transparent-and-standardised-sts-securitisation).  This page visualises some of the data that ESMA has published about STS securitisations.

Unless stated otherwise, the data visualised here ranges from the beginning of 2019 to the end of March 2020.

You should also bear in mind that the charts on this page give a breakdown of STS securitisations by *number* of securitisations; ESMA does not publish information about the size of each securitisation, so the below charts do not say anything about the *value* of assets that have been securitised.

number_sts = """**Number of STS securitisations**

Below you can see the cumulative number of notified STS securitisations over the time period, as well as the number of new STS securitisations that were notified to ESMA each month.

private_public = """**Private and public STS securitisations**

The Securitisation Regulation and the associated technical standards distinguish between public securitisations (in respect of which a prospectus must be drawn up under the EU's Prospectus Regulation) and private securitisations.  ESMA publishes extensive details on public STS securitisations, such as details of the parties involved, certain details of the transaction documents, etc.  By contrast, although details of private STS securitisations must be notified to ESMA, only a small subset of those details are published on ESMA's website, such as the nature of the underlying assets being securitised.

As you can see from the below pie chart, most STS securitisations notified to ESMA have been public securitisation.

Because of the limited amount of information available about private STS securitisations, most of the rest of this page will focus on public STS securitisations only (unless otherwise stated).
"""

underlying = """**Underlying assets**

ESMA publishes information about the types of underlying assets that are being securitised.  You can see the breakdown in the chart below.  Note that, because ESMA publishes this information about all STS securitisations (public and private), this data includes private securitisations.  """
